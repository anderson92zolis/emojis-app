This is a  React application that demonstrates how to create a list of emojis using components, props and maps function.

### Instructions

<br>

1. Extract the repeated parts of the App into a Entry component.

2. Use props to make the Entry component render different data.

3. Import the emojipedia constant.
4. Map through the emojipedia array and render Entry components.
> Emojipedia has 3 entries, so createEntry gets called 3 times.
> Each time, it passes 1 item from the emojipedia array as a var called emojiTerm.
